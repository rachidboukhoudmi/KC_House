**KC House Dataset Project**
**Project Overview**
This project involves analyzing and predicting housing prices in King County, which includes Seattle. The dataset provides various features related to the houses, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more. We will use pandas_profiling to conduct an initial exploratory data analysis and TPOT for automating the machine learning pipeline.

**Dataset Description**
The KC House dataset includes the following features:

id: Unique identifier for each house.
date: Date the house was sold.
price: Price of the house.
bedrooms: Number of bedrooms.
bathrooms: Number of bathrooms.
sqft_living: Square footage of the living area.
sqft_lot: Square footage of the lot.
floors: Number of floors.
waterfront: Whether the house is a waterfront property.
view: Quality of the view from the house.
condition: Condition of the house (rating from 1 to 5).
grade: Overall grade given to the house, based on King County grading system.
sqft_above: Square footage of the interior housing space that is above ground level.
sqft_basement: Square footage of the basement.
yr_built: Year the house was built.
yr_renovated: Year the house was renovated.
zipcode: ZIP code of the house.
lat: Latitude coordinate.
long: Longitude coordinate.
sqft_living15: Square footage of living space in 2015 (implies some data update).
sqft_lot15: Square footage of the lot in 2015 (implies some data update).

**pandas_profiling**
pandas_profiling is a library that generates profile reports from a pandas DataFrame. The report includes a variety of statistical metrics, visualizations, and warnings about potential data issues. It helps in understanding the dataset's structure, detecting anomalies, and preparing the data for further analysis.

**TPOT**
TPOT (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool) is an automated machine learning (AutoML) tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming. TPOT automates the process of feature selection, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning to create the best possible model for the data.

**Project Requirements**
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
pandas
pandas_profiling
tpot
scikit-learn

**Installation**
You can install the necessary packages using pip:
pip install pandas pandas_profiling tpot scikit-learn

**How to Run**
Clone the repository.
Install the required packages.
Load the dataset (kc_house_data.csv).
Run the pandas_profiling script to generate the data profiling report.
Run the TPOT script to find and export the best machine learning pipeline.

**Conclusion**
This project aims to provide insights into the KC House dataset and leverage automated machine learning to predict housing prices. The initial data analysis using pandas_profiling and model optimization using TPOT ensures a thorough and efficient workflow for data scientists and analysts.
